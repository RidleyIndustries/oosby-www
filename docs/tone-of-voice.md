## Design Collaboration

- Whitespace = breathing room → keep sentences short; never crowd text.
- Typography supports tone → large, calm headings; soft contrast; generous leading.
- Colour cues tone → warm neutrals and plum for calm moments; orange for active CTAs.
- Iconography → soft edges, minimal linework — human, not robotic.

## Quick DO / DO NOT

✅ DO

- Lead with benefit, not feature.
- Keep lines short and clear.

- Use em dash
